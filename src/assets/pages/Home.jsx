            I'm Nisrine and i'm studying software engineering and product
            managment with a background in psychology and public arts policy.
            What drives me in this field is the ability to turn ideas into real,
            tangible solutions while maintaining full autonomy in the process.
          </span>{" "}
          <span>
            Coming from disciplines that blend creativity and human
            understanding, I wanted to strengthen my technical foundation, to
            build products that are not only functional but also meaningful.
          </span>{" "}
          <span>
            Iâ€™ve been looking to develop hard skills that will benefit me
            throughout my life, both personally and professionally.
          </span>{" "}
          <span>
            I hope the atmosphere of my portfolio also conveys my passion for
            literature and history.
          </span>{" "}
          <span>
            I believe that software engineering and product managment is an art,
            one through which we can tell countless stories.
