            I'm Nisrine, and I'm studying software engineering and product
            management. What I love about this field is that it allows me to be
            truly autonomous in my work. I have a background in psychology and
            in political arts. I've been eager to develop soft skills which turn
            into hard skills that will benefit me throughout my life, both
            personally and professionally. I love building things from scratch,
            but what I enjoy most is exchanging ideas with other tech
            professionals to gain new insights. Other then that, i have a
            passion for literature and history. I believe working in tech is an
            art, one through which we can tell countless stories.
